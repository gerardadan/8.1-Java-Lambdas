## ðŸ“„ Description

This set of exercises focuses on Java Lambdas and Streams, utilizing features introduced in Java 8+. The exercises will guide you through working with functional programming concepts, method references, functional interfaces, and stream operations.

## ðŸš€ Exercises

### Exercise 1: Filtering Strings by Character
- Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that contain the letter 'o'.
- Print the resulting list.

### Exercise 2: Filtering Strings by Character and Length
- Modify the previous method to return a list of strings that:
  - Contain the letter 'o'.
  - Have more than 5 characters.
- Print the resulting list.

### Exercise 3: Printing List Elements with Lambda
- Create a list with the names of the months of the year.
- Print all the elements of the list using a lambda expression.

### Exercise 4: Printing List Elements with Method Reference
- Modify the previous exercise to print the list using a method reference instead of a lambda.

### Exercise 5: Functional Interface for Pi Value
- Create a **Functional Interface** with a method named `getPiValue()`, which returns a `double`.
- From the `main()` method, instantiate the interface and assign it the value **3.1415** using a lambda.
- Invoke the `getPiValue()` method and print the result.

### Exercise 6: Sorting Strings by Length (Ascending)
- Create a list with both numbers and text strings.
- Sort the list so that the strings appear in ascending order of length.

### Exercise 7: Sorting Strings by Length (Descending)
- Modify the previous exercise to sort the list in descending order, from the longest to the shortest string.

### Exercise 8: Functional Interface for String Reversal
- Create a **Functional Interface** that contains a method named `reverse()`, which:
  - Takes a `String` as input.
  - Returns the reversed version of that `String`.
- In the `main()` method, implement this interface using a lambda.
- Invoke the instance of the interface with a string and verify that it returns the expected reversed output.
